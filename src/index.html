		<h2 class="title">Is it Possible To Call And Schedule An Ambulance Just Like Uber?</h2>
		<img src="img/action.jpg" alt="image" class="main__img">

		<div class="wrap">
			<p>In the fight for a human life, every minute counts. In situations where time is limited – like stressful moments when urgent medical care is required – the price of a delay can be too high.</p>
			<p>The emergency care provision can be slower than molasses sometimes. In New York City, paramedics took on average almost 13 minutes to get to patients who called 911 in 2015. If patients are really sick or badly injured, 13 minutes may be far too long for them to keep fighting for their lives without acute medical care. Unfortunately, the lack of Emergency Medical Services units as well as unintentional or malicious delays put thousands of lives at risk in the US and Canada - both in busy cities and far-off rural areas. On the upside, the good news is that the evolution of heath care is a constant process that never stops.</p>
			<img src="img/emsfind.jpg" alt="EMSFind">
			<p>Thanks to an innovative service called EMSFIND, (<a href="http://emsfindapp.com/">http://emsfindapp.com/</a>) anyone throughout the US and Canada can receive medical transportation services on demand. The one-of-a-kind platform is designed to connect the ambulance providers to patients without any delay. It сo-operates with a network of medical transport companies, which guarantees excellent patient-centered services.</p>

			<div class="col-img col-img_right">

EMSFIND is a crucial app for pregnant women who are at risk of experiencing a premature birth as well.</p>
